<h2>Building:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Side Jump with Cover: Place two stairs going up and then put a cone at the top of the second stair. Then, on the second stair, jump to the side and make two more stairs. Repeat.
    <li>Before engaging with someone, block off all signs of danger.</li>
    <li>If a person is under you spraying you or has no cover, you can jump and shoot them; preferably with a pump, and then immediately place a floor. Because of delay, they won’t know what hit them.</li>
    <li>If someone is in a box with no cone or stair and if there is no floor or cone in front of their box, you can look a bit under their wall and phase a cone in their box. Then, predict their reaction on where they will go and box them up.</li>
    <li>Don’t box yourself in wood.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Editing:</h2>
<p>(I am going to be combining editing with other stuff to leave out confuseness)</p>

<h3>(Editing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When you do an edit, finish it at your opponent so you have a momentum when shooting them.</li>

</ul>

<h3>(Piece Control)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Plan out your piece control before you just run in and go with your gut.</li>
  <li>The person that is doing the movement has the advantage</li>
  <li>When you see someone with only 1 wall in their box, get their back, side, and then front wall. You can also struggle to get a cone in there. Then just piece them up with a diagonal peak or a window edit.</li>

</ul>

<h3>(Peaking)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are standing on a cone and your opponent is in the middle of their box or your box, you can do a wall edit where you open the bottom right 2 spots and then also one up from the bottom right. Now if you are still standing on the cone you can shoot them but they won’t see you.</li>
</ul>
